Deflate.py : 
"deflate" an image by moving the edges in one pixel at a time, stopping each edge when there is a nonzero image gradient somewhere along its length 

Inflate.py :
"inflate" an image by expanding the edges out one pixel at a time, stopping each edge when there is a nonzero image gradient somewhere along its length 
- Requires starting dimensions (ex: "deflated" dimensions of the image)
